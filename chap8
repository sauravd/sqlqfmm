“List customers and the dates they placed an order, sorted in order date sequence.”

SELECT Customers.CustFirstName || ' ' || Customers.CustLastName AS CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
	FROM (Customers 
	INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
) ORDER BY Orders.OrderDate;




“List employees and the customers for whom they booked an order.” 
(Hint: The solution requires a JOIN of more than two tables.)
You can find the solution in CH08_Employees_And_Customers (211 rows).
